# Outdoor Autonomous Delivery Robot
## Neutrons Team Graduation project - Masnoura University 2023
This repo will have our graduation project documentation (Step by Step) until the completion of its all features.
Our gradution project is "Outdoor Autonomous Delivery Robot v2.0"

## Problem Statement 

In terms of both the variety of new applications and the degrees of interest among established actors in the automotive, truck, public transportation, industrial, and military worlds, the field of autonomous robots is expanding quickly around the world. Robotic systems that are autonomous have the potential to significantly improve operational effectiveness and safety. The importance of creating last-mile deliveries that are quicker, cheaper, and sustainable is increasing due to the explosive expansion of e-commerce. Autonomous robots can be used to address a variety of issues, including decreased capacity, a driver shortage, damaged and stolen goods, unsuccessful delivery efforts, increased road congestion, etc. An autonomous robot is one that has been developed and manufactured to function for lengthy periods of time without human assistance.

## Project Description
A mobile robot that is fully autonomous based on ROS technology for outdoor campus delivery like compounds, factories, and universities.
As the problem statement shows that we need to deploy robotics science to our needs which change with different times and ages. We have developed our robot to satisfy the needs of delivery across closed campuses which seem to have big areas and open roads. Our robot can facilitate this mission for humans which can take a much effort and time.
Our robot uses ROS technology to localize, map and navigate across the campus map in addition to the 360 degrees Lidar system that avoid crashing with any moving object that may obstacle our robot. It also re-paths the route taken by the navigation stack according to the real-life sensing of the surrounding environment. 
The robot is also equipped with a camera for:
•	live tracking the robot.
•	verification of the shipment owner through (face recognition or QR code).
•	verification of delivery of the shipment.

Our robot is always connected to a central control unit for support and data flow to receive its next goal through a manual input goal or goal called from the user through a mobile application or GPS location. It's also connected to handling any bugs or non-familiar behaviour.

## What's Next
We are now updating this version through the bugs we found.

We will include new features like:
* research the interaction between our robot and other robots with the same system, or other aerial systems like drones.
* Add Mobile Application Acess to our system and integrate visualizations and controllability in it.
* Add Computer-Vision Algoritms to assist our system.
* Add more security options.
